# Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning 💰  
### Python | Machine Learning | Data Analysis

This project predicts whether a **loan application will be approved or rejected** using **Logistic Regression**, based on applicant financial and personal information.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Loan approval is a crucial decision-making process in the banking and finance sector.  
This project applies **machine learning classification techniques** to historical loan data to automate and improve prediction accuracy.

The trained model classifies loan applications as:
- ✅ Approved
- ❌ Rejected

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze loan applicant data  
- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing  
- Encode categorical features  
- Train a Logistic Regression model  
- Evaluate model accuracy  
- Display prediction results
